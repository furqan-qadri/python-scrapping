# Exercise 12: Display Fibonacci series up to 10 terms
# Have you ever wondered about the Fibonacci Sequence? Itâ€™s a series of numbers in which the next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. The first two numbers are 0 and 1.

# For example, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. The next number in this series is 13 + 21 = 34.

# Expected output:

# Fibonacci sequence:
# 0  1  1  2  3  5  8  13  21  34

def fibonacci():
   num1=0
   num2=1
   sum=1
   for i in range(10):
       print(sum)
       num1=num2
       num2=sum
       sum=num1+num2
       
# y=[x for x in range(25,50) if x%2==0 ]
# print(y)
fibonacci()
